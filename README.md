#Neon Overview
Neon is a software platform designed to help you, as a developer, to integrate your disparate visualization widgets with your data stores. The **Data Access API** makes it easy for widgets to query NoSQL databases directly from JavaScript or RESTful endpoints, while still letting the server do the heavy lifting. The **Interaction API** provides capabilities for inter-widget communication, which easily links your widgets together. Neon does not provide any user interface components. Instead, Neon shines under-the-hood by removing the pressure from developers to figure out *how* to make different components work together and allowing them to focus more on the fun stuff, like creating valuable data exploration applications and workflows.

## View an example application

To see an example of what's possible with Neon, check out the [Neon Geo Temporal Dashboard][neon-gtd].  You can see it running on our demo server running an [Neon Geo Temporal Dashboard Demo][neon-gtd-demo] built with Neon.  Originally part of this project, it has been spun off to a sister project and is meant to be deployed as a separate web application alongside core Neon.  Read more about how to use it and how it interacts with Neon [here][neon-gtd-guide].

## Quick Start: Build and run the example
Building the example application requires Java JDK 1.7 or 1.8, node.js, and MongoDB. To install everything you need on Ubuntu 14.04, run

    sudo apt-get install git openjdk-7-jdk mongodb unzip npm nodejs-legacy

On Fedora 20, run

    sudo yum install git unzip mongodb mongodb-server java-1.7.0-openjdk-devel npm
    sudo systemctl start mongod
    
On Windows, you will need to download and install each requirement separately and ensure that the JDK, Mongo, and Git bin directories are on your path.

1. With the prerequisites out of the way, drop to a command prompt, get Neon and give it a basic configuration:

        git clone https://github.com/NextCenturyCorporation/neon.git
        cd neon/
        cp gradle.properties.sample gradle.properties

2. Then import the example data into a MongoDB collection:

        cd examples
        unzip earthquakes.zip
        mongoimport --db test --collection earthquakes --type csv --headerline --stopOnError --file earthquakes.csv
        mongo test --eval "db.earthquakes.find().forEach(function(doc){doc.time = new ISODate(doc.time);db.earthquakes.save(doc)});"
        cd ..

3. Finally, build and run the Neon server using Jetty. The following command will launch a test web server on port 8080:

        ./gradlew jettyRun -Pmongo.host=localhost

Point your web browser at [http://localhost:8080/neon/examples](http://localhost:8080/neon/examples) and select one of the single page example files to view a simple query, filter, or database listing.  If they display the earthquake data listed above, you have successfully configured your development environment.  If you have another web server running on that port, you may need to shut it down prior to the Jetty command.

3 (alternate). Deploying Neon.  If you are using Tomcat, you can use that web container instead of Jetty. Run the following command to create a Neon war file: 
      
        ./gradlew war

Copy the Neon war file to your Tomcat directory webapps:

        cp ./neon-server/build/libs/neon-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT.war [tomcat]/webapps

To view the examples, copy the [neon-dir]/examples/*.html file to the [tomcat]/webapps/ directory.  If the Tomcat server is not running on port 8080, then the examples will need to be changed so that the Neon.js file can be found.  Modify the line:

        <script src="http://localhost:8080/neon/js/neon.js"></script>

to point to the appropriate port.
